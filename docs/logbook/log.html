	<h1>The Z Programming Language<br>Development Log 2020</h1>
	<article>
		<h1>T1W10</h1>
		<p>
			In-line with the <em>Project Plan</em>, the development
			evironment was installed. This included installing the
			Deno runtime, and setting up the environment for working
			with the Visual Studio Code IDE. The primary image required,
			the 'Z' logo, was designed.

		<h1>T1W11</h1>
		<h2>11/12th April</h2>
		<p>
			To meet the T1W11 plan, the lexer, syntax-checker, and debugging
			messages were developed. These were developed as separate modules
			which in hind-sight probably slowed the implementation of the 
			algorithms, due to module-importing complexities.<br>
			By the end of the two days, the compiler could:
			<ul>
				<li>read a source file,</li>
				<li>generate an ordered list of language tokens,</li>
				<li>and generate a syntax tree based only on the
					<code>PROG ENDPROG</code> and 'assignment' structures.</li>
			</ul>
			The Lexing was achieved using regular expressions, which tested
			each word input and returned a category (keyword, number, etc.).

		<h2>13th April</h2>
		<p>
			Today was spent attempting to create a special Syntax-Checker
			that could accept a list of rules and test given data. This
			was an interesting endeavour, however it proved fruitless due
			to difficulties managing recursion. It may be picked up during
			the later stages of development to make the code more flexible
			and easier to understand.<br>
			Part of the setback was due to complexities of JavaScript's
			function parameters. It is easy to forget that an Array
			being passed in is passed as a reference; this means that a 
			change to it in an external function (such as one called to
			recurse) will change its contents back outside, causing headaches
			when trying to figure out where something went wrong. This is
			solved by print the value of the Object when it is passed in, 
			and when that called function returns.
		</p>
		<h2>14th April</h2>
		<p>
			Today focused on implementing more syntax checks. This included
			parsing Input Statements, Conditions (which required recursion),
			Do Blocks, Pre-Tests and Output Statements. It also threw certain
			errors depending on where an invalid token was encountered. Each
			parser for a structure type was called, "popping" each token
			off of the Token-Array. If it threw a ParserError, the mistake
			was "mine" for calling it and so the Syntax-Checker attempted
			to parse the tokens with another parser. If a SyntaxError was
			discovered, the token was discarded and this meant that the user
			input was invalid, i.e. a malformed statement was provided.<br>
			At the end of the day, the program could reliably provide a
			Syntax Tree for more of Z's features.
		</p>
		<h2>15th April</h2>
		<p>
			Today focused on finishing the Syntax-Checker, and implementing
			the compiler to Python. An error was found in the syntax-checker
			regarding scopes. Some keywords end a scope, while others end a
			structure. A distinction was made and this solved an issue whereby
			the end of the program was reached because too many scopes were
			exited, thus leading to the end of the input by exiting the PROG
			scope.<br>
			The compiler included special functions for converting input from
			the user to numbers or strings depending on the input data. This
			was achieved by including a Python function in the outputed code.<br>
			As a test of the compiler, a fizzbuzz program was successfully
			written.
		</p>
		<h2>16th April</h2>
		<p>
			Today focused on polishing the compiler some more. The Python
			program was supplemented with another function, allowing
			variables of different types to be cast and used in assignment
			statements. This meant casting the value to be assigned to the
			data type of the variable to hold the value. This means that if
			<code>A1</code> holds the value <code>Hi</code>, then
			<code>= A1 2 +</code> will result in <code>A1</code> having the
			value <code>Hi2</code>.<br>
			To further test the compiler, Modulo, Fibonnaci and Squares
			programs were written and compiled and run successfully.

		<h1>Hol.W2</h1>
		<p>
			Work has been delayed by a week, but this is works with the
			Project Plan which allows for extra buffering should delays
			be encountered in development.

		<h1>T2W1</h1>
		<h2>28th April</h2>
		<p>
			Begin the process of cleaning up folder structure, and think
			about a pre-compile stage to filter lexical tokens.
		</p>
		<h2>1st May 2020</h2>
		<p>
			Convert to an Object based approach for parsing.
			<br>
			I re-wrote the parser and lexer, to be cleaner. Internal documentation is still lacking.<br>
			It runs surprisingly quick, almost instantaneously!
		</p>
		<h2>3rd May 2020</h2>
		<p>
			GUI in place, with File, Edit, Help buttons and menus visible but not functional.<br>
			The editor also supports syntax highlighting.<br>

		<h2>4th May 2020</h2>
		<p>
			Minor tweaks to formatting page.

			Turns out that t.shift() was removing the token on error,

			Considering re-doing to the parser again to present a clearer logic,

		<h1>T2W4</h1>
		<h2>22nd May 2020</h2>
		<p>
			After reviewing Web technologies, the "New" option
			is not needed in the "File" editor menu. A HTML input
			can be used to both open a file, and the native dialog
			also allows creating a new file.<br>
			The "Info" option is also seeming to be unnecessary, and so
			too will be removed.<br>
			The "Cut", "Copy", "Paste" menus are nice, but can be completed
			by the user using Right-Click and are thus unncessary. Thus, 
			"settings" will be moved to the "File" menu, and the "Edit" menu
			removed.

		<h2>27th May 2020</h2>
		<p>
			The Web Editor is now capable of send a script to be run on the server.
			Next to be implemented is WebSockets between the browser and server.
